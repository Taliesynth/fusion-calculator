After suffering at some point, Jack Frost decided to turn into Black Frost. Now more mean-spirited, Black Frost is quite deadly with his pranks. His powers have increased ever since his evolution from Jack Frost. 
Among the many Jack forms, he is the only one able to learn both Fire and Ice skills.
